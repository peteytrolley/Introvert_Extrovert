    "This is where the model pipeline was created. First I applied the K-nearest neighbors imputation method to handle the missing values. This looks at a chosen number of points closest to each point containing a missing value to fill what is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a logistic regression model using a LASSO penalty was used for classification. LASSO is used for variable selection in the logistic regression model. Predicted values (0 or 1) were then mapped back to their respective categories ('Extrovert' or 'Introvert') and saved as a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each step in the pipeline, parameters were optimized using cross validation with GridSearchCV."
